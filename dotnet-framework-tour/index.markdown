The [.NET Framework](http://www.microsoft.com/net) has been around [since 2002](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework_version_history#.NET_Framework_1.0) and recently Microsoft announced they are open sourcing the [.NET Core Library](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2014/12/04/introducing-net-core.aspx) and [.NET CoreCLR](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2015/02/03/coreclr-is-now-open-source.aspx).  The team is estimating that there will be over 5 million lines of code available on GitHub once it is fully open sourced.

In order to learn more about what the .NET Framework has to offer I will be exploring the various namespaces and types with the .NET Framework Tour Newsletter.  If you would like to join along of the adventure sign up below:

## More about .NET Framework Tour
The .NET Framework provides helpful libraries and classes to enable the .NET developer to accomplish tasks effectively and quickly.  With over [300+ namespaces and 11,000+ types](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/brada/archive/2008/03/17/number-of-types-in-the-net-framework.aspx) (and those numbers are from several versions ago) it is near impossible to  know them all.

I will going through in no particular order exploring the functionality and features using a [repository I have started on GitHub](https://github.com/jsturtevant/DotNetTour).  If you have any favorite types or features that you use on a daily basis please send me an [email](mailto:jsturtevant@gmail.com) and I will be sure to check them out and try to do a feature on them.
