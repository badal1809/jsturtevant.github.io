My name is [James Sturtevant](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/james-sturtevant/42/1a9/922).  I get really excited about anything related to coding.  I love exploring and solving problems with software.  I find joy in building [tools](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/2d045428-ec7e-4a77-802c-5365f9ddafa2) that make myself and others more efficient.  

The web has always been a place for me to explore and learn.  Recently, I realized that I had valid ideas and knowledge that I could contribute to the vast interweb.  I have learned so much from all the people who have been sharing on the web over the years and I hope this little corner of the web will help some one learn that little bit of information that helps them build great software.  If it does let me know at [jsturtevant@gmail.com](mailto:jsturtevant@gmail.com).

###Background
I have been working around computers since I can remember.  My grade school teachers were not sure if it was OK for me to hand in printed book reports.  It wasn't long before I taught my self C++ and wrote multiple choice quiz programs to test myself and friends for biology class.  I moved on to writing websites in high school when the [marquee tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/marquee) was still cool.  Now I build web applications but with the hip technologies of the day such as [AngularJs](https://angularjs.org/) and [ASP.NET](http://www.asp.net/).  

I believe in life long learning and completed my [Microsoft Certified Solutions Developer: Web Applications](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/en-us/mcsd-web-apps-certification.aspx) (MCSD) tests earlier this year.   Because I also believe that you learn best through teaching and sharing I help organize the [Augusta Polyglot Programming Group](http://augusta-polyglot.github.io/) where we do hands on activities in a variety of languages.
