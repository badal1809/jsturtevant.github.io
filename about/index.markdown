My name is [James Sturtevant](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/james-sturtevant/42/1a9/922). I enjoy teaching and learning about my craft of software development.  I have been building software in the web arena for 10+ years and I am a [Microsoft Certified Solution Developer(MCSD)](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/en-us/mcsd-web-apps-certification.aspx) in Web Applications.

Below are a few activities that you might find me doing on any given day. 

### Speaking

I believe that you learn best through teaching and sharing.  With [Floyd Hilton](http://floydhilton.com/), I founded and help organize the [Augusta Polyglot Programming Group](http://augusta-polyglot.github.io/) where we do hands on activities in a variety of languages.  We welcome all programmers regardless of skill level or language.  [Send me an email](mailto:jsturtevant@gmail.com) if your interested in hear more about the group.
