There is a lot of information out there and it can be overwhelming.  Below is a short list of tools and resources I use regularly. I will update this list as I find more great tools to share.

## Resources to Learn New stuff
- [Microsoft Virtual Academy](https://mva.microsoft.com/) is one of the hidden gems of the free development training of the internet.  There are thousands of free training courses available on topics ranging from Python to C#.  

- [PluralSight](http://www.pluralsight.com/) - Online tutorials and videos on everything tech related.  The high quality videos are well worth the small monthly fee.

## Tools 
- [Cmder](http://bliker.github.io/cmder/) - Let's face it the command line tool in Windows is less than ideal.  With this replacement you can not only re-size the command window but also copy and paste directly into the command line.  On top of that it has [git](http://git-scm.com/) and [PowerShell](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptcenter/powershell.aspx) integration.  Finally, it is portable... stick it on a USB drive (or Dropbox) and off you go into command line heaven across machines.

- [Paint.net](http://www.getpaint.net/) - Simple image editing tool that lets you get done what you can't with MS Paint.

- [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) - Small, fast and portable, Notepad++ plus is a must for making small edits to text files or opening large CSV files.  

- [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) -  A great UI for Git.  Once you get to use to the interface it will be an indispensable tool.

## IDEs -  Integrated Development Environments 
- [Visual Studio Community Edition](http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs) - Visual Studio is now free!  This is hand down one of the best [IDE's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) out there and until recently was prohibitively expensive.  I use Visual Studio *everyday* as a professional developer.  What is even better is with [Xamiran](http://xamarin.com/) integration you can create cross platform mobile apps.  And if your a keyboard shortcut fanatic, don't forget to check out my plug-in [AceJump](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/2d045428-ec7e-4a77-802c-5365f9ddafa2).
