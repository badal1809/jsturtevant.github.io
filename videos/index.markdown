Videos are a great way to learn new skills.  Watching someone use a tool or work through a problem can be worth a thousand words.  I always watch my videos on double speed, something I call "plugging into the matrix".  These videos are ones have created with the help of many.  Enjoy!

## Microsoft Virtual Academy
[Microsoft Virtual Academy](https://mva.microsoft.com/) is one of the hidden gems of the free development training of the internet.  There are thousands of free training courses available on topics ranging from Python to C#.  

- [A Guide to Object-Oriented Practices](http://aka.ms/guide2oo) - If you’re a Developer who has started learning object-oriented practices, and you’d like more guidance applying them, this is your course! Explore encapsulation, inheritance, interfaces, and more, in these modules that discuss and demonstrate the importance of object-oriented practices.
 
    In each section, see examples of object-oriented practices using familiar classes from the .NET framework. Because major sections of the .NET Framework are now open source, we use open source examples to illustrate the advantages of these practices. The examples and the labs use .NET and C#, but the techniques and concepts are applicable to any object-oriented language.

- [Angular Applications with TypeScript](http://aka.ms/angulartypescript) - Are you a Developer looking to expand your skill set? Check out TypeScript, a language which can help improve your productivity, especially as compared to JavaScript. The type system enables tooling which can find many common coding errors. In this course, learn TypeScript within the context of Angular apps.
 
    Explore the major features of TypeScript, and see how they can make teams more productive, create an Angular 1.x application, and learn how TypeScript enables and supports interaction with JavaScript libraries. Get a tour of TypeScript, look at two-way databinding, find out how to work with callbacks and asynchronous tasks, plus much more.

## Channel9 
[Channel9](https://channel9.msdn.com/) is a free form version of training.  There is everything from Build Conference Talks to clips to improve any programming skill you can image. 

### Interviews
- [Vermont Code Camp 7](https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/raw-tech/Vermont-Code-Camp-7) - Vermont Code Camp is a full day event that brings together technology community members, students and professionals from around Vermont and beyond.
