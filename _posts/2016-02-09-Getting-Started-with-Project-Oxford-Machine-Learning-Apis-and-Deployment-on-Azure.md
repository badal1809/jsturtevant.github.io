[Project Oxford](https://www.projectoxford.ai/) is cool.  I am out at a lot of hackathons where I see students creating some amazing applications.  While at the hackathons I see students struggling to get started with Project Oxford in their language of choice.  Project Oxford is so powerful that I hate to see students struggle getting started so I created a [series of videos](https://channel9.msdn.com/Search?term=project%20oxford%20sturtevant#lang-en=en&ch9Search) and [sample projects](https://github.com/jsturtevant/happy-image-tester-django) to get them started quickly.  But Project Oxford is not only for hackathons and students.  Project Oxford has tons of real world applications such as [image and video processing, OCR](https://www.projectoxford.ai/vision), and [text to speech](https://www.projectoxford.ai/speech).

Watch the videos to learn more:

### Sample projects
The sample project that used in the series is located at [https://github.com/jsturtevant/happy-image-tester-django](https://github.com/jsturtevant/happy-image-tester-django). If you prefer Node.js I have a made a similar project located at [https://github.com/jsturtevant/happy-image-tester-nodejs](https://github.com/jsturtevant/happy-image-tester-nodejs).

### Project Oxford API's
You can find API wrappers for many of the languages:
- [Official API's for c# and more](https://github.com/Microsoft/ProjectOxford-ClientSDK)
- [Python API](https://github.com/southwood/project-oxford-python)
- [Node.js API](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/project-oxford)
