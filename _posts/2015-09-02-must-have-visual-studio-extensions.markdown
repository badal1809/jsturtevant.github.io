There are alot of Visual Studio extensions out there and it has always surprised me at the number of Visual Studio users don't know some of the must have extensions.  Here is a list of my top 5 extensions that I must have installed and one bonus.

- [Productivity Power Tools 2015](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/34ebc6a2-2777-421d-8914-e29c1dfa7f5d?SRC=VSIDE) - This extension brings powerful tools for improved developer productivity.   Once installed there is no configuration nessary to start taking advantage of great features like the Syntactic Line Compression and Match Margin.

- [Web Essentials 2015](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/ee6e6d8c-c837-41fb-886a-6b50ae2d06a2?SRC=VSIDE) - If you do any type of web development inside visual studio this is a must have.  It adds tons of great supoport for HTML5, JavaScript and other web tools like LESS.

- [SideWaffle Template Pack](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/a16c2d07-b2e1-4a25-87d9-194f04e7a698?SRC=VSIDE) - Additional Templates for both item and projects.  Provided templates are suitable for building websites, Windows apps, Windows Phone apps, WPF, Visual Studio extensibilty projects and a lot more.  

- [Roaming Extension Manager](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/7b421a95-c32c-4433-a2be-a41b276013ab) -  With all the extensions that you are going to install you need a way to track them across multiple machines.  This extension does just that.

- [Visual Studio Spell Checker](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/a23de100-31a1-405c-b4b7-d6be40c3dfff?SRC=Featured) - Spelling is not my strong suite so why not let the spell checker do all the hard work.

### Bonus
So I have to give me self a little plug here and draw attention to my extension called [AceJump for Visual Studio](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/2d045428-ec7e-4a77-802c-5365f9ddafa2). It is one I use all the time and it has great reviews, so that might count for something.  If your a keyboard fanatic then this is a great tool otherwise you will probably never use.  If you install it and use it, let me know what you think by leaving a commenter below.  

## Conclusion
There are a lot of extensions out there but those are just a few of my favorites that have changed the way I interact with Visual Studio.  If you have any you think I am missing be sure to let me know below.
