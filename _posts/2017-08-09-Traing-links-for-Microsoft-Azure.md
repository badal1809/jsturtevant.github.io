I often get asked how to get trained up on a given Microsoft technology.  Like anything, there is a lot of info out there, so here is a consolidated list where I would get started.  You can go to each resource and search for the technology you are interested in.  I always start at the free tier then work up from there if I feel I need/want more.

## Microsoft Virtual Academy (free)
Good for full overview of tech with both hands on and presentation style.

## Channel9 (free)
Good for learning more about specific part of tech.  Often more specific subtopics of a given tech.

## 3rd party video content (pay)
More high quality video training to supplement Channel9 and MVA

## Professional programs (pay)
Currently limited selection of tech, but very structured Profession role based training that gives you a credential at the end.

## Certification Programs (pay for cert)
If your looking for Certifications the Microsoft Certification program is a good place.  You can get good idea of what is covered on the exam (and there for things you should generally know/learn) from the exam prep pages.
