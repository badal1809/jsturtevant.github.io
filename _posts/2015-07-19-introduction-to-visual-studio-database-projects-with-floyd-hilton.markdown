I have talked about [Visual Studio database projects](/posts/Visual-Studio-2013-SQL-Server-Database-Projects/) before but this time I got to sit down with a expert who has implemented them many time before. In this [video](https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/raw-tech/Introduction-to-Visual-Studio-Database-Projects) I talk to [Floyd Hilton](https://twitter.com/fhilton) about Visual Studio Database Projects.  Floyd introduces us to Database Projects and how they are used.  He covers how to import your database, source control for SQL and what a Dacpac is.  You can find more resource on [Floyd Hilton's blog.](http://floydhilton.com/).
