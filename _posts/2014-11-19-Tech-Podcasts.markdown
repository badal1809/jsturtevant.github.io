One of the best things I have started to do over the last year is listen to technical podcasts.  Whether I am commuting to work or washing the dishes, I get to stay on top of the last tech news and learn about new (and old) technologies. I get direct access to some of the brightest and most talented people in our industry.  On top of all that, they are very often entertaining.

Podcast apps are notoriously bad but I recently switch [PlayerFM](https://player.fm/).  I like this podcast player because it syncs across platforms, has double speed (I listen at 1.7x.  Give it a try you might never go back), and it is easy to share useful links.

Below is a short list of some of my favorites right now.  Even though I work in .NET currently I find the podcasts about other languages interesting and useful for broadening my horizons.

- .NET Rocks - [Site](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/) - [PlayerFM](https://player.fm/series/dot-net-rocks)
- MS Dev Show - [site](http://msdevshow.com/) - [PlayerFM](https://player.fm/series/ms-dev-show)
- HanselMinutes - [Site](http://www.hanselminutes.com/) - [PlayerFM](https://player.fm/series/hanselminutes)
- Ruby Rogues -[Site](http://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/) - [PlayerFM](https://player.fm/series/the-ruby-rogues)
- Security Now -[Site](http://twit.tv/show/security-now) - [PlayerFM](https://player.fm/series/security-now-mp3)
- Hello World - [Site](http://wildermuth.com/hwpod) - [PlayerFM](https://player.fm/series/the-hello-world-podcast)
- Functional Geekery - [Site](http://www.functionalgeekery.com/) - [PlayerFM](https://player.fm/series/functional-geekery-46817)

There are many other podcasts that I listen to about business, entrepreneurship and other topics but this is a good starting point for anyone interested in technical podcasts.  

Did I miss any?  I would love to hear your thought's about these and other podcasts.
