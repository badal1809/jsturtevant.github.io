This past weekend I was able to partcipate in [Hack Harvard 2016](http://hackharvard.io/) as a mentor.  Hackathon are always a great time and this year there were some [really great hacks](https://hackharvard2016.devpost.com/) ranging from solving social media bullying to auto populating calendars to a portable translator.

I got to work with lots of great teams on lots of problems but there is one that I wanted to make sure got documented.  Thanks to [Moaaz Elsayed](https://github.com/moaazelsayed) who did a create write up on [How to Connect Unity to Cognitive Services and Azure Table Storage](https://github.com/moaazelsayed/UnityAzureConnection).  

When using Unity to make exteranl HTTP request, there are a few nuances around how you need format the requests and Moaaz did a great job summarizing a few of the challenges he resolved over the course of the weekend.  It covers how to attach an image, add request headers, and adding a json body to a post request.  Many other scenarios will either be a combination or derivative of those.
