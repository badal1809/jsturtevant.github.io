In this interview I talk with [Bryan Soltis](https://twitter.com/bryan_soltis) from [Kentico](http://www.kentico.com/).  Bryan is a Technical Evangelist for Kentico and has been working with Azure since it was in beta.  In this video he talks about a tool developed internally to help manage Kentico's Improvement Program, which is an optional program that gives anonymous feedback on features being used directly to Kentico.  Bryan talks to us about why he chose Azure and more specifically why he chose [Azure Table Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/storage-dotnet-how-to-use-tables/).  He even shows us a quick glimpse of the code used to query Azure Table storage.  

Bryan is on twitter at [@bryan_soltis](https://twitter.com/bryan_soltis) and he writes on Kenitco and Azure on his [blog](http://devnet.kentico.com/authors/439927/bryan-soltis).
