The .NET Framework has been around since 2002 and recently Microsoft announced they are open sourcing the [.NET Core Library](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2014/12/04/introducing-net-core.aspx) and [.NET CoreCLR](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2015/02/03/coreclr-is-now-open-source.aspx).  The team is estimating that there will be over 5 million lines of code available on GitHub once it is fully open sourced.

The .NET Framework provides helpful libraries and classes to enable the .NET developer to accomplish task effectively and quickly.  With over [300+ namespaces and 11,000+ types](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/brada/archive/2008/03/17/number-of-types-in-the-net-framework.aspx) (and those numbers are from several versions ago) it is near impossible to  know them all...

In order to learn more about what the .NET Framework has to offer I will be exploring the various namespaces and types through what I am calling the .NET Framework Tour.  If you would like to join along of the adventure sign up for the .NET Tour email list:



I will going through in no particular order exploring the functionality and features using a [repository I have started on GitHub](https://github.com/jsturtevant/DotNetTour).  If you have any favorite types or features that you use on a daily basis please send me an [email](mailto:jsturtevant@gmail.com) and I will be sure to check them out and try to do a feature on them.
