I often am asked by my co-workers about good resources for developers. So to help anyone that might be looking for curated developer resources, I have added a page with the [resources](/resources) that I use on a regular basis.  The list has a little bit of everything...  utility tools, IDE's, and reference sites like the [.NET source code](http://microsoft.github.io/). In the future I hope to add some of my favorite books that I have found most useful in furthering my skills.  And if you enjoy podcasts you should check out my list of recommended [developer podcasts](/posts/Tech-Podcasts/).

I love to learn about other tools that make my work easier so if you have a resource that is a must have let me know in the comments.

Happy Holidays!
