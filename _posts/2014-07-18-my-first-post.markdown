I was suppose to take months to create this blog, allowing me to tell everyone *I was working on my blog*.  Months were going to go by writing my own css from scratch and coding the coolest javascript framework, maybe even writing my own [blog engine](http://blog.codinghorror.com/on-frameworkitis/).  Instead after only 2 hours of setup time I am writing my first post.  What happen?

The power of building on others work.

## Building blocks
The internet is full of things to learn.  You could learn about the [slap stick](http://www.slaperoo.com/sounds.htm) or take free course from the top level colleges in the world such as [MIT](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm).  

It is the openness and social aspect of the internet that is so powerful.  We live in a time where we are able to learn and share with people from all around the world. We are mixing ideas and cultures in exciting ways we are only just starting to understand. 

By sharing ideas and experiments it allows other to learn from each other and build amazing things.  It is allowing [students](http://moocnewsandreviews.com/after-every-astronomy-book-in-pakistan-a-12-year-old-turns-to-moocs/) from all over the world to learn subjects that were not easily accessible to them just a few years ago...  building blocks that might just lead to the next great idea.  

## The Adjacent Possible

The **adjacent possible** is a concept developed by [Stuart Kauffman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Kauffman). In the book *Where Good Ideas Come From*, [Steven Johnson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NugRZGDbPFU) expands upon this concept. Johnson's summarizes where we get our ideas in his [TED Talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/steven_johnson_where_good_ideas_come_from):

>We like to think our breakthrough ideas, you know, are like that $40,000, brand new incubator, state-of-the-art technology, but more often than not, they're cobbled together from whatever parts that happen to be around nearby.

This is a fascinating concept when combined with all the content available through the internet today.  What are the adjacent possibilities for innovation just around the next corner in a shared and connected world?

I see adjacent possibilities developed in my [breakneck](http://oclc.org/publications/nextspace/articles/issue22/whatkeepsyouupatnighttherapidpaceofchange.en.html) industry everyday.  From the latest javascript framework to the new languages being developed.  We are constantly trying new things and sharing the experiences so we can move forward.  

## Moving Forward
This is my first step in contributing.  I had to overcome many fears to post this first entry but leveraging the graciously shared work of others I was able to get started right away.  My blog may not be innovative or earth shattering but I hope it helps someone cobble together a great idea.

I am grateful to all the projects that I used to get up and running quickly:

- [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/)
- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
- [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Installing jekyll on windows](http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/)
