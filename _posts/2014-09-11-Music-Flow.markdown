As developers we are often searching for *The Flow*... that special place where we are fully focused and making things happen.  This is a lot of information about what *The Flow* is and how one might get there, so instead I am going to focus on one tool I use and some observations I have made.

## Music
Music is often an important part of the developers ability to get into *The Flow*.  Headphones and music could be the only thing that gets you through the busy  (and loud) morning in the office.  Sometimes even that [doesn't work](posts/Coding-with-music/).  

Recently there has been a lot of tools coming out to help you get into *The Flow*. Everything from a [music service](https://www.focusatwill.com/) that helps you focus to [Brain Similators](http://www.foc.us/) that gives a small electric current to you prefrontal cortex.  There is even an industry leader, Carl Franklin, who is started a kickstarter, [Music to code by](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/311638984/music-to-code-by), to create his own music that is designed specifically for getting into *the flow* while coding.
