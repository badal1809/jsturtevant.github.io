As developers we are often searching for *The Flow*... that special place where we are fully focused and making things happen.  There is a lot of information about what [*The Flow*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)) is and how one might get there, but I find I music is a constant that helps me getting into *The Flow* consistently.

## Music and the Flow
Music is often an important part of the developers ability to get into *The Flow*.  Headphones and music could be the only thing that gets you through the busy  (and loud) morning in the office.  Sometimes even that [doesn't work](posts/Coding-with-music/).  

Recently, there have been a lot of tools coming out to help you get into *The Flow*. Everything from a [music service](https://www.focusatwill.com/) that helps you focus to [Brain Similators](http://www.foc.us/) that gives a small electric current to you prefrontal cortex.  There is even an industry leader, Carl Franklin, who is started a kickstarter, [Music to code by](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/311638984/music-to-code-by), to create his own music that is designed specifically for getting into *the flow* while coding. 

## Finding your Music Flow
Unfortunately it isn't as easy as simply putting headphones on and turning on music.  Having clear goals ([Trello](https://trello.com/) help me here)  and a immediate feedback loop (some sort of testing loop) are important but so is your music choice.

I found that the type of task and project I am working on is conductive to different types of music.  Almost always it is music with out lyrics.  Here are few options I have found helpful:

- When I am creating new features I like to have [Up-tempo](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/up-tempo) music  that helps me channel creativity.  
- When I am re-factoring a like to have [Chill/Down-Tempo](http://www.pandora.com/station/play/2203348506665711458) music that helps me relax and concentrate on the task at hand. 
- When I working on a complex task it is plain acoustical music that will help me solve the problem.

What ever your music style take some time to try different types and reflect on how the music choice helped you accomplish your task and get you into *The Flow*.  Experiment and have fun, everyone will have different preferences. And don't forget to leave a comment to let me know what your preferences are.  Enjoy ***The Flow***.
