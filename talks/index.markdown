## Web Dev 

### Introducing TypeScript 2+
TypeScript has seen enormous growth over the past year. Across the board developers are falling in love with TypeScript as they find it to be the most productive way to work with JavaScript. With TypeScript 2.0, it only gets better. In this session, we will show how adding TypeScript to existing JavaScript projects is easier than ever. We will dive into the biggest features of the 2.0 release such as non-nullable types, read-only modifiers, and down-level async/await. Finally, we will talk about the future of TypeScript and what you can expect in the coming months. 

### ASP.NET Core Introduction 
The cloud is no longer only water molecules in the sky. Developing web applications today 
 requires developers to be agile, faster than ever, and have the ability to scale on a moment’s notice. Come to this session see how ASP.NET Core is designed to be Cloud Ready so you can build applications that are ready for the modern web. You will learn about new features in ASP.NET Core and see how improvements to the ASP.NET architecture make developing for the cloud faster. By the end of the session you will have a firm understanding of why a new version ASP.NET was developed, how it impacts you as a developer and how to begin to leverage ASP.NET to build modern cloud applications. 

### A developers look at ASP.NET Security
Security is an ever important topic that has increasingly gotten attention with high-profile cases in the news.  Have you gone back to review your code to make sure that you are following the latest recommendations? Do you know what those recommendations are?  In this talk, we will walk through practical changes you can make to your ASP.NET applications to make sure you are following the recommendations of the security community.  We will look at examples in both ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core, discussing differences and similarities between the approach each take.  By the end of the talk, you will walk away with actionable items you can begin looking into right away.

### Debugging Node.js with Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code is a powerful, yet lightweight, tool for developing in all kinds of languages, including Node.js.  In this session, you will see how easy it is to get started debugging your Node.js applications using Visual Studio Code.  We will start with the basics of stepping through debugging on local code, then cover more complex scenarios such as debugging remote machines.

## Cloud Computing

### Introduction to Service Fabric 
Orchestration, automation, and monitoring are just some of the challenges when moving to container technology. Service Fabric is a distributed services platform that solves these challenges and more. It is a battle tested system that is used inside Microsoft for its mission critical applications such as Azure SQL, Document DB, and Bing Cortana - processing more than 500 million evaluations per second. In this session we will explore Service Fabric and see how it helps to solve the challenges of distributed computing. 

### Docker Fundamentals: Getting Started with Container Technologies 
Docker is everywhere today but what is it? In this talk, we will start from the beginning to introduce containers and explore why they have become so popular. Next, we will take a look how to get started using Docker in your applications today and finally how to deploy containers using Azure. By the end, you will have seen containers in action, know how to create your first container and understand your path to production.

### Real World Container Deployments Using Docker and Azure
Containers are a hot topic these days and it is easy to get started with them in development but what happens when you are ready to go to production?  In the talk, we will look at some of the possible scenarios for deploying Linux containers in Azure.  We will start out looking at Azure Web Apps for Linux to see how it can enable us to deploy any application (Node.JS/Python/ASP.NET Core/etc) and learn how to scale the site based on demand.  We then use Docker Swarm to deploy a more complex application scenario discussing the differences in the services.  By the end, you will have seen several ways to deploy your applications to Azure understand the tradeoff between services.

### IoT and Azure Functions
We will examine how IoT and Serverless come together so you can build scalable systems in a fast modular way.  How small, single purpose functions can fit into an IoT architecture enabling you to be flexible as you design the system.  We will briefly look at features Azure has to offer for IoT and then look at how to extend the system using Azure Functions to provide functionality like alerts, device management, and Cloud to Device communication.  By the end of the session, you will have seen real use cases from projects that have been built at Microsoft and know how to add leverage serverless in IoT scenarios.

## Machine Learning 

### Flight Data Machine Learning Challenge 
Wouldn’t you like to be able to predict when your flight will be delayed? Come explore how easy it is to use Azure Machine Learning to generate your own flight predictions. First, this workshop will walk you through each step to create a base level prediction model using data we provide. Then, we’ll provide insights on tweaking the model to improve the prediction. Finally, you can explore by making your own changes to produce an even better model. You will painlessly gain exposure to the basic Machine Learning workflow and related terminology while having fun as you gain hands-on experience. Bring your laptop because by the end of the workshop, you will have built your own flight prediction model and explored how to make it perform better. Best of all, you will never be left wondering if your flight will be delayed again! 

### Standing on the Shoulders of Giants 
Machine Learning no longer requires years of experience to implement. Come to this session to learn how you can use Cognitive Services to stand on the shoulders of giants to create powerful and unique insights for your users. During the talk, we will explore how to add machine learning capabilities such as vision, speech, facial recognition and language understanding into your web application.

### Building Resilient Mobile Applications 
Most applications require a backend service to do the complex processing.  In this session, we will see how to build resilient communication with a backend service in the mobile world where we are not always connected to our service.  Using a Xamarin application, We will focus on techniques like request prioritization, caching and more.  By the end of the of the talk, you will be familiar with several techniques to ensure your app performs well in all situations and learn about a few libraries that enable resiliency in your applications. 

### Using TypeScript in your Angular 1.X applications 
A quick look at how to bring TypeScript into your existing applications and the benifts you will reap.

### Vorlon.Js - Debugging in a Multidevice World 
Wouldn't it be nice to never again have to ask the question, "What browser are you using"?  With Vorlon.JS, an open source, platform agnostic tool built with love from the web developers at Microsoft, your ability to be a multidevice debugging master becomes a reality.  In this interactive talk, you will learn how to deploy, use and run Vorlon.js.  See how it can help you remotely debug and test your JavaScript on multiple devices. Because after all, it’s a multidevice world, and development requires a multidevice debugging tool. 

### Introduction to Roslyn Diagnostics

Stop worrying about the forgotten TODO statements or missed exception checks and get back to solving business problems.  Even if you are not a compiler expert, now that the .NET Compiler Platform is open source and extensible you can begin to leverage the powerful compiler by learning only a few simple concepts.   In this session, you will learn the basics of syntax and semantics, then use the ideas to write Diagnostics Analyzers to check for common errors, enforce your coding standards, and make coding fun again. 

### Visual Studio 2015: A developers guide
The next version of Visual Studio is here! In this session, we will explore many of the features in Visual Studio 2015 and how they increase developer productivity.
