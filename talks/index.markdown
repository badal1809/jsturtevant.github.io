## Web Dev 

### Building Location Based Applications 
Augmented Reality and Location-based technologies have hit the mainstream in gaming but when it comes to other industries the full potential has yet to be realized.  In this session, we will cover backend design patterns and trade-offs you need to consider while building scalable Location-Based Applications.   The patterns lend themselves to micro services that can scale independently and during this session we will look at a concrete implementation using Azure Service Fabric.  

Key Takeaways:

- What are Location-based applications and why are they important
- Techniques and design patterns and their trade-offs
- How to leverage micro services to scale the individual components independently

### Introducing TypeScript 2.0 
TypeScript has seen enormous growth over the past year. Across the board developers are falling in love with TypeScript as they find it to be the most productive way to work with JavaScript. With TypeScript 2.0, it only gets better. In this session, we will show how adding TypeScript to existing JavaScript projects is easier than ever. We will dive into the biggest features of the 2.0 release such as non-nullable types, read-only modifiers, and down-level async/await. Finally, we will talk about the future of TypeScript and what you can expect in the coming months. 

### Introduction to Service Fabric 
Orchestration, automation, and monitoring are just some of the challenges when moving to container technology. Service Fabric is a distributed services platform that solves these challenges and more. It is a battle tested system that is used inside Microsoft for its mission critical applications such as Azure SQL, Document DB, and Bing Cortana - processing more than 500 million evaluations per second. In this session we will explore Service Fabric and see how it helps to solve the challenges of distributed computing. 

### Vorlon.Js - Debugging in a Multidevice World 
Wouldn't it be nice to never again have to ask the question, "What browser are you using"?  With Vorlon.JS, an open source, platform agnostic tool built with love from the web developers at Microsoft, your ability to be a multidevice debugging master becomes a reality.  In this interactive talk, you will learn how to deploy, use and run Vorlon.js.  See how it can help you remotely debug and test your JavaScript on multiple devices. Because after all, it’s a multidevice world, and development requires a multidevice debugging tool. 

### ASP.NET Core Introduction 
The cloud is no longer only water molecules in the sky. Developing web applications today 
 requires developers to be agile, faster than ever, and have the ability to scale on a moment’s notice. Come to this session see how ASP.NET Core is designed to be Cloud Ready so you can build applications that are ready for the modern web. You will learn about new features in ASP.NET Core and see how improvements to the ASP.NET architecture make developing for the cloud faster. By the end of the session you will have a firm understanding of why a new version ASP.NET was developed, how it impacts you as a developer and how to begin to leverage ASP.NET to build modern cloud applications. 

### Using TypeScript in your Angular 1.X applications 
A quick look at how to bring TypeScript into your existing applications and the benifts you will reap.

### Docker Fundamentals: Getting Started with Container Technologies 
Containers are everywhere today. In this talk we will take a look at the various options for using and deploying containers to Azure and the differences between them. We will see containers in action, cover what your options are and why you might choose one technology over the other. 

## Mobile 

### Building Resilient Mobile Applications 
Most applications require a backend service to do the complex processing.  In this session, we will see how to build resilient communication with a backend service in the mobile world where we are not always connected to our service.  Using a Xamarin application, We will focus on techniques like request prioritization, caching and more.  By the end of the of the talk, you will be familiar with several techniques to ensure your app performs well in all situations and learn about a few libraries that enable resiliency in your applications. 

### Designing Inclusive Applications in Mobile Development
The world we live in is becoming more connected every day. As mobile app developers, we need to design for inclusiveness. Beyond the UI considerations, this includes concerns like building experiences that support multiple languages, options for audio/text, and multiple bandwidth scenarios. We will look beyond the UI into architecture for several solutions, including a Xamarin app that was designed for Refugees in Amman, Jordon.  By the end of the session, you will have gained new insight into design decisions that will help you build inclusive applications.

Key Takeaways:

- Why is it important to build inclusive applications
- UX and Architectural Design decisions to be aware of
- See real-world code that can be used to enable inclusive applications

## Machine Learning 

### Flight Data Machine Learning Challenge 
Wouldn’t you like to be able to predict when your flight will be delayed? Come explore how easy it is to use Azure Machine Learning to generate your own flight predictions. First, this workshop will walk you through each step to create a base level prediction model using data we provide. Then, we’ll provide insights on tweaking the model to improve the prediction. Finally, you can explore by making your own changes to produce an even better model. You will painlessly gain exposure to the basic Machine Learning workflow and related terminology while having fun as you gain hands-on experience. Bring your laptop because by the end of the workshop, you will have built your own flight prediction model and explored how to make it perform better. Best of all, you will never be left wondering if your flight will be delayed again! 

### Standing on the Shoulders of Giants 
Machine Learning no longer requires years of experience to implement. Come to this session to learn how you can use Cognitive Services to stand on the shoulders of giants to create powerful and unique insights for your users. During the talk, we will explore how to add machine learning capabilities such as vision, speech, facial recognition and language understanding into your web application.
